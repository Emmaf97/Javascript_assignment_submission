# Javascript Project based on D&D (Dungeons & Dragons) Game
## Goal of project
### To allow newcomers to the D&D world learn how to play the game and allow familiar players to look at other content on the site such campaigns and external videos.

## Currency Converter
#### I created a currency converter that was based on a select element.The currency would be converted correctly based on the symbol that the user picked. This would apply to all the same elements that have the currency. This is explained in more detail in the convertCurrency.js file.

## Particle Effect using Canvas
#### I created a particle effect using the canvas. I have an effect where the text floats into the screen and when the user moves their mouse over the text, the text moves around the mouse. I go into more detail how this was achieved in the canvas.js file.

## Darkmode using local storage.
#### I created Darkmode Functionality utilising the local storage. If the button is clicked darkmode is toggled, if the button is clicked again the darkmode is untoggled. You can see more detail as to how this was achieved in the darkmode.js file

## Form Validation
#### I have created a form and have required fields that only take certain inputs e.g. number field only takes integers. This code can be seen in the formValidation.js file.
