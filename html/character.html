                <h2>Elves</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Slender and Graceful</h2>

                <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members
                    of
                    many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet
                    tall
                    to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and
                    females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>

                <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper,
                    bronze,
                    and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves
                    have
                    no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple
                    yet
                    lovely jewelry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>A Timeless Perspective</h2>

                <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the
                    shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be
                    curious
                    than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal,
                    however,
                    whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and
                    relentless.
                    They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty
                    insults
                    with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Exploration and Adventure</h2>

                <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries
                    of
                    exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to
                    day
                    but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their
                    own
                    pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and
                    adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and
                    others
                    might become champions of moral causes.</p>

                <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
                    nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Hidden Woodland Realms</h2>

                <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and
                    grow
                    vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing
                    and
                    plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their
                    contact
                    with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items
                    for
                    metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Elf Names</h2>
                <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth
                    birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>
                <p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a
                    youngster
                    might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might
                    reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists
                    between
                    male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every
                    elf
                    bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among
                    humans
                    translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>

                <p>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
                    adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims
                    adulthood
                    and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>

                    You
                    can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
                    dim

                <p class="bold-text">Trance</p>
                <p>Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
                    (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion;
                    such
                    dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After
                    resting
                    in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
                <p class="bold-text">Languages</p>
                <p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
                    intricate
                    grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other
                    races.
                    Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>

                <h2>DragonBorn</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Proud Dragon Kin</h2>

                <p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a
                    tail.
                    The
                    first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations
                    of
                    interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or
                    bronze
                    in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly
                    built,
                    often
                    standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong,
                    talonlike
                    claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Self-Sufficient Clans</h2>

                <p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and
                    respect
                    to
                    their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or
                    her
                    clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his
                    or
                    her
                    station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>

                <h2>Dragonborn Names</h2>
                <p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of
                    honor. A
                    childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of
                    endearment.
                    The name might recall an event or center on a habit.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Short and Stout</h2>

                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though
                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a
                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any
                    of
                    the larger folk.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h2>

                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very
                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of
                    the
                    Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the
                    fortress
                    and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on
                    the
                    world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Clans and Kingdoms</h2>

                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals
                    and
                    forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in
                    some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains,
                    they
                    gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade
                    in
                    dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf
                    settlements,
                    though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h2>

                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own
                    sake,
                    for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven
                    by
                    the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of
                    the
                    dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s
                    lost
                    honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having
                    been
                    exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of
                    battle
                    centuries ago.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Dwarf Names</h2>
                <p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name
                    has
                    been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the
                    individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden
                    by
                    law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Vibrant Expression</h2>

                <p>A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes
                    average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually
                    adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with
                    excitement.
                    Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s
                    insatiable
                    interest in everything around.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Delighted Dedication</h2>

                <p>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of
                    enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over
                    the
                    course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in
                    their
                    long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the
                    things they want to do and see.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Bright Burrows</h2>

                <p>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than
                    dwarves
                    do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden
                    by
                    both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright,
                    warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Gnome Names</h2>
                <p>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and
                    uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or
                    might
                    not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant
                    relatives,
                    though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about
                    names,
                    a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname,
                    choosing
                    the one in each category that’s the most fun to say.</p>

                <p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with
                    both
                    parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5

                    to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than

                    Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven
                    coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety
                    even
                    more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven

                    discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of
                    clothing.
                </p>

                <p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous,
                    happily
                    sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>

                <h2>Blend into the Crowd</h2>

                <p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves
                    valuable
                    and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings
                    to
                    avoid unwanted attention.</p>

                <p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or
                    otherwise.
                    They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

                <h2>Pastoral Pleasantries</h2>

                <p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely
                    build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t
                    recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them.
                    Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>

                <p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them
                    abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving
                    wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.

                    loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature.
                    Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with
                    the

                <h2>Scarred and Strong</h2>

                <p>Half-orcs exhibit a blend of orcish and human characteristics, and their appearance varies widely.
                    Grayish skin tones and prominent teeth are the most common shared elements among these folk.
                </p>
                <p>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars,
                    though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former prisoner or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has
                    lived
                    among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their
                    past
                    exploits and injuries.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>The Mark of Gruumsh</h2>

                <p>The one-eyed god Gruumsh—lord of war and fury—created the first orcs, and even those orcs who turn
                    away
                    from his worship carry his blessings of might and endurance. The same is true of half-orcs. Some
                    half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that
                    simmers
                    within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee combat — and either exult
                    along
                    with him or shiver with fear and loathing.
                </p>

                <p>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse,
                    it
                    makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh
                    loudly and heartily, and simple pleasures — feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild
                    dancing —
                    fill their hearts with joy.</p>

                    wants
                    to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names
                    decide
                    to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.</p>

                <p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common
                    races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall
                    and
                    weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair
                    colors
                    from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or
                    thick.
                    A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages.
                    Humans
                    reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.

                <h2>Variety in All Things</h2>

                <p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying
                    tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle,
                    though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for
                    long
                    centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or
                    culture
                    preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully
                    in
                    the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving
                    to
                    leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they
                    stay
                    alert to changing political and social dynamics.

                    They
                    seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Infernal Bloodline</h2>

                <p>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look
                    human.
                    However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large
                    horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight
                    and
                    tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails,
                    four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their
                    canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or
                    gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but
                    also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually
                    dark,
                    from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h2>

                <p>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest
                    quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes
                    they
                    live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.
                </p>
                <p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they
                    have
                    to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a
                    tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same
                    trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for
                    life.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Tiefling Names</h2>
                <p>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have
                    names
                    reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through
                    generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a
                    place
                    in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that
                    concept.
                    For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.</p>
