                Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They
                live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with
                faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves
                love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Slender and Graceful</h2>

            <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of
                many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall
                to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and
                females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>

            <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze,
                and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have
                no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet
                lovely jewelry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>A Timeless Perspective</h2>

            <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the
                shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious
                than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however,
                whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless.
                They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults
                with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>

            <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and
                compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from
                intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the
                need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Exploration and Adventure</h2>

            <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of
                exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day
                but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own
                pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and
                adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others
                might become champions of moral causes.</p>

            <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
                nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Hidden Woodland Realms</h2>

            <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow
                vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and
                plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact
                with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for
                metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>

            <h2>Elf Names Names</h2>
            <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth
                birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>
            <p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster
                might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might
                reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between
                male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf
                bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans
                translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>

            <h2>Elf Traits</h2>
            <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven
                refinement.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase</p>
            <p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Age</p>
            <p>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
                adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood
                and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Size</p>
            <p>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Speed</p>
            <p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Darkvision</p>
            <p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
                can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
                light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Keen Senses</p>
            <p>You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Fey Ancestry</p>
            <p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Trance</p>
            <p>Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
                (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
                dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting
                in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Languages</p>
            <p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate
                grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.
                Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>

                Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them
                with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally
                hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some
                dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and
                still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Proud Dragon Kin</h2>

            <p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail.
                The
                first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of
                interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or
                bronze
                in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built,
                often
                standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong,
                talonlike
                claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p>

            <p>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn
                often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or
                white,
                lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Self-Sufficient Clans</h2>

            <p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect
                to
                their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her
                clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or
                her
                station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>

            <p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn
                value
                skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts
                before
                they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members
                of
                other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p>

            <p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in
                difficult
                situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to
                another
                dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.

            <h2>Dragonborn Names</h2>
            <p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A
                childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of
                endearment.

                Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and
                hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of
                goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Short and Stout</h2>

            <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though
                they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a
                human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of
                the larger folk.</p>

            <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light
                brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually
                black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly
                and groom them carefully.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h2>

            <p>TDwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very
                different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the
                Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress
                and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the
                world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>

            <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with
                stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry
                back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon
                those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold
                the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p>

            <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the
                point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs
                they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins
                as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.
            </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Clans and Kingdoms</h2>

            <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and
                forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in
                some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains, they
                gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in
                dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements,
                though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>

            <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who
                live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related
                dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that
                can befall a dwarf.</p>

            <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some
                become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h2>

            <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake,
                for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by
                the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the
                dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost
                honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been
                exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle
                centuries ago.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Dwarf Names</h2>
            <p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has
                been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the
                individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by
                law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>

                A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their
                close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor
                explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight
                in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Vibrant Expression</h2>

            <p>A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes
                average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually
                adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement.
                Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable
                interest in everything around.</p>

            <p>A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his
                wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome’s
                clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery,
                embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Delighted Dedication</h2>

            <p>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of
                enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the
                course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their
                long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the
                things they want to do and see.</p>

            <p>Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas
                and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the
                appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.</p>
            <p>Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the
                more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and
                inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what
                they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Bright Burrows</h2>

            <p>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves
                do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by
                both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright,
                warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.</p>

            <p>Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human
                families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted
                enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or
                her long life.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="card">
            <h2>Hidden Woodland Realms</h2>

            <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow
                vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and
                plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact
                with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for
                metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>

            <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
                nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>
        </div> -->
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Gnome Names</h2>
            <p>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and
                uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might
                not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives,
                though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about names,
                a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing
                the one in each category that’s the most fun to say.</p>

            <h2>Elf Traits</h2>
            <p>Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of
                exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if
                dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life
                eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the
                great annoyance of their adventuring companions.</p>

            <p>Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by

                Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best
                qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the
                refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set
                apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely
                touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven
                realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either
                society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring
                life.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Of Two Worlds</h2>

            <p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both
                parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet
                to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women.
                Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven
                coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even
                more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Diplomats or Wanderers</h2>

            <p>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome
                in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are
                sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other
                half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p>

            <p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without
                meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers,
                foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by
                the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of
                society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Half-Elf Names</h2>
            <p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in

                The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far
                from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine
                conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form
                nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the
                wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though
                home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Small and Practical</h2>

            <p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that,
                avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to
                survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are
                inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.
            </p>
            <p>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown
                and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare
                among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes,
                favoring bright colors.</p>
            <p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple
                pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures
                locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most
                straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Kind and Curious</h2>

            <p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as
                the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them
                usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love
                discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
            </p>

            <p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily
                sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Blend into the Crowd</h2>

            <p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable
                and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to
                avoid unwanted attention.</p>

            <p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise.
                They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

            <p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely
                build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t
                recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them.
                Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>

            <p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them
                abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving
                wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.

            <h2>Halfling Names</h2>
            <p>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames

            <h2>Halfling Traits</h2>
            <p>Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.
            </p>
            <p class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase</p>
            <p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Age</p>
            <p>A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second
                century.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Size</p>
            <p>Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Speed</p>
            <p>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Lucky</p>
            <p>When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die
                and must use the new roll.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Brave</p>
            <p>You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Halfling Nimbleness</p>
            <p>You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Languages</p>
            <p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are
                loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature.
                Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the
                people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</p>

                Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of
                conflict, orc and human communities, sometimes form alliances. When these alliances are sealed by
                marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud leaders of orc communities. Some
                venture into the world to prove their worth. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for
                their mighty deeds.

            <h2>Scarred and Strong</h2>

            <p>Half-orcs exhibit a blend of orcish and human characteristics, and their appearance varies widely.
                Grayish skin tones and prominent teeth are the most common shared elements among these folk.
            </p>
            <p>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars,
                though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former prisoner or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived
                among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past
                exploits and injuries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>The Mark of Gruumsh</h2>

            <p>The one-eyed god Gruumsh—lord of war and fury—created the first orcs, and even those orcs who turn away
                from his worship carry his blessings of might and endurance. The same is true of half-orcs. Some
                half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers
                within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee combat — and either exult along
                with him or shiver with fear and loathing.
            </p>

            <p>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it
                makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh
                loudly and heartily, and simple pleasures — feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing —
                fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action
                than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. And when their hearts swell with love, they leap to
                perform acts of great kindness and compassion.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Half-Orc Names</h2>
            <p>Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants
                to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide
                to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.</p>

            <h2>Half-Orc Traits</h2>
            <p>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.
            </p>
            <p class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase</p>
            <p>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Age</p>
            <p>Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably
                faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Size</p>
            <p>Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall.
                Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Speed</p>
            <p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Darkvision</p>
            <p>Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light
                within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t
                discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Menacing</p>
            <p>You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Relentless Endurance</p>
            <p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You
                can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Savage Attacks</p>
            <p>When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice
                one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Languages</p>
            <p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It
                has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.</p>

                In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the
                world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their
                shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they
                feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on
                the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers,
                and the pioneers of the worlds.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>A Broad Spectrum</h2>

            <p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common
                races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and
                weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors
                from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick.
                A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans
                reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Variety in All Things</h2>

            <p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying
                tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle,
                though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long
                centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture
                preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in
                the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to
                leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay
                alert to changing political and social dynamics.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Exemplars of Ambition</h2>

            <p>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They
                seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other
                people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Human Names and Ethnicities</h2>
            <p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human
                parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or
                less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the naming
                traditions of their ancestors.</p>
            <p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In
                the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are
                different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the
                east—and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary
                according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches
                have every possible variation of coloration and features.
            </p>
            <p>In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are
                found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be
                used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.</p>

            <p class="bold-text">Calishite</p>
            <p>Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes.
                They’re found primarily in southwest Faerûn.</p>

                black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of

            <p>Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and
                amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands

                To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
                fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is
                because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into
                their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin,
                for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.

            <h2>Infernal Bloodline</h2>

            <p>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human.
                However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large
                horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and
                tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails,
                four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their
                canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or
                gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but
                also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark,
                from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.

            <h2>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h2>

            <p>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest
                quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they
                live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.
            </p>
            <p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have
                to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a
                tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same
                trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for
                life.</p>

            <h2>Tiefling Names</h2>
            <p>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names
                reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through
                generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a place
                in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept.
                For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.</p>
