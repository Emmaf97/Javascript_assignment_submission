        <h1>Create Your Character</h1>
        <div class="card border-class">

        <p>Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game is to imagine and create a
            character of your own.
            Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.
            You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard).
            You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
            Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons &amp;
            Dragons world.</p>

        <p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play.
            You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard.
            Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes
            hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar.
            Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races.
            Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class.
            If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons book
            to see what catches your interest.</p>

        <p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character
            you want.
            Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make.
            What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.</p>

        <p>Throughout this section, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character,
            whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record,
            or a piece of notebook paper.
            An official D&amp;D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and
            how you use it during the game.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>1. Choose a Race</h1>
        <div class="card border-class">

        <p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world.
            The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.
            Some races also have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.
            The Races section provides more information about these races.</p>

        <p>The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general
            appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry.
            Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain
            weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells.
            These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2).
            For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to
            be powerful wizards.
            Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too.
            Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>

        <p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3.
            Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>

        <p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet.
            Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>2. Choose a Class</h1>
        <div class="card  border-class">

        <p>Every adventurer is a member of a class.
            Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he
            or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense
            negotiation.
            The character classes are described in the Classes section.</p>

        <p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class.
            Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character
            apart from members of other classes.
            You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools.
            Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain
            weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>

        <p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Level</h2>
    <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points
            (XP).
            A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a
            soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>

        <p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life.
            If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&amp;D campaign, your DM might
            decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few
            harrowing adventures.</p>

        <p>Record your level on your character sheet.
            If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels
            past 1st.
            Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP.
            A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see
            “Beyond 1st Level” later in this section).</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">

        <p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations.
            Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>

        <p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class.
            You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description.
            (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point
            maximum.</p>

        <p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet.
            Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have.
            After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in the Adventuring section).</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">

        <p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level
            character.
            Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</li>
            <li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>
            <li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>
            <li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>
            <li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>
            <li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and
            tool proficiencies.
            (Skills are described in "Using Ability Scores", tools in "Equipment.")
            Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more
            proficiencies.
            Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p>

        <p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once.
            Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.
            If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it
            should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it
            only once.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>3. Determine Ability Scores</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity,
            Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
            Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
        <p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores section.
            The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability,
            what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.</p>
        <p>You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly.
            Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper.
            Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers.
            If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the
            following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>

        <p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores
            to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
            Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p>
        <p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers
            table.
            To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then
            divide the result by 2 (round down).
            Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores.
            The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose
            individually.</p>
        <p>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.
            The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table.
            For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points.
            Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases.
            You can’t have a score lower than 8.</p>
        <p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low
            ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12,
            12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p>

        <h2>4. Describe Your Character</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person.
            Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she
            behaves in general terms.</p>

        <p>Using the information in the Personality and Background section, you can flesh out your character’s physical
            appearance and personality traits.
            Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals.
            The Personality and Background section also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear,
            called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.</p>

        <p>Your character’s background describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the
            character’s place in the D&amp;D world.
            Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in the Personality and Background
            section, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your
            character concept.</p>

        <p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and
            it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools.
            Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Your Character's Abilities</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and
            personality.
            A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart
            character with low Strength.</p>
        <p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low
            Strength might be scrawny or plump.</p>
        <p>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be
            either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.</p>
        <p>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character
            with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.</p>
        <p>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low
            Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.</p>
        <p>A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A
            character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.</p>
        <p>A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating
            presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>5. Choose Equipment</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other
            adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the
            Equipment section.</p>
        <p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting
            equipment.
            You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment section.
            Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section. If you wish, you can also have one
            trinket at no cost (see the "Trinkets" table at the end of the Equipment section).</p>
        <p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total
            weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. "Using Ability Scores" has more information on
            carrying capacity.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Armor Class</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that
            contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all
            characters wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>
        <p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character
            wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment section. Record
            your AC on your character sheet.</p>
        <p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor
            and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a
            shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in the Equipment section.</p>
        <p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features
            that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the
            damage you deal when you hit.</p>
        <p>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are
            proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.</p>
        <p>For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
            finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.</p>
        <p>For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon that
            has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>6. Come Together</h2>
        <div class="card border-class">
        <p>Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers
            working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to
            survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
            Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met,
            and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.</p>
