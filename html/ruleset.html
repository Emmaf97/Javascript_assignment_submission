                        <h2>Create Your Character</h2>

                    <p class="p-card">Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game is to imagine and
                        create
                        a
                        character of your own.
                        Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination.
                        You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard).
                        You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
                        Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the
                        Dungeons &amp;
                        Dragons world.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>1. Choose a Race</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D
                        world.
                        The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.
                        Some races also have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.
                        The Races section provides more information about these races.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>2. Choose a Class</h2>

                    <p class="p-card">Every adventurer is a member of a class.
                        Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and
                        the
                        tactics he
                        or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a
                        tense
                        negotiation.
                        The character classes are described in the Classes section.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class.
                        Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your
                        character
                        apart from members of other classes.
                        You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes
                        tools.
                        Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using
                        certain
                        weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>Level</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining
                        experience points
                        (XP).
                        A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have
                        been
                        a
                        soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life.
                        If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&amp;D campaign,
                        your
                        DM might
                        decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already
                        survived a few
                        harrowing adventures.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous
                        situations.
                        Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>

                    <p class="p-card">At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class.
                        You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class
                        description.
                        (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your
                        hit
                        point
                        maximum.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2>

                    <p class="p-card">The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a
                        1st-level
                        character.
                        Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character
                        sheet:
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-card">Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of
                        your
                        skill and
                        tool proficiencies.
                        Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more
                        proficiencies.
                        Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character
                        sheet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>3. Determine Ability Scores</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength,
                        Dexterity,
                        Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
                        Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly.
                        Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch
                        paper.
                        Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers.
                        If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can
                        use
                        the
                        following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores
                        and
                        Modifiers
                        table.
                        To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability
                        score
                        and then
                        divide the result by 2 (round down).
                        Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores.
                        The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you
                        choose
                        individually.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.
                        The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table.
                        For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points.
                        Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial
                        increases.
                        You can’t have a score lower than 8.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and
                        three
                        low
                        ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13,
                        13,
                        12, 12,
                        12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a
                        person.
                        Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and
                        how he
                        or she
                        behaves in general terms.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">
                        Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and
                        ideals.
                        The Personality and Background section also helps you identify the things your character holds
                        most
                        dear,
                        called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">Your character’s background describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation,
                        and
                        the
                        character’s place in the D&amp;D world.</p>

                <div class="card-character border class">
                    <h2>Your Character's Abilities</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance
                        and
                        personality.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character
                        with
                        low
                        Strength might be scrawny or plump.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity
                        might be
                        either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A
                        character
                        with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character
                        with
                        low
                        Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.</p>

                    <h2>5. Choose Equipment</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons,
                        armor,
                        and other
                        adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in
                        the
                        Equipment section.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your
                        starting
                        equipment.
                        You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment
                        section.
                        Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section. If you wish, you can
                        also
                        have one
                        trinket at no cost (see the "Trinkets" table at the end of the Equipment section).</p>
                    <p class="p-card">Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a
                        total
                        weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. "Using Ability Scores" has more
                        information on
                        carrying capacity.</p>

                    <h2>Armor Class</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things
                        that
                        contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity
                        modifier.
                        Not all
                        characters wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your
                        character
                        wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment
                        section.
                        Record
                        your AC on your character sheet.</p>

                    <h2>Weapons</h2>
                    <p class="p-card">For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the
                        weapon
                        and the
                        damage you deal when you hit.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if
                        you
                        are
                        proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon
                        that
                        has the
                        finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.</p>
                    <p class="p-card">For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee
                        weapon that
                        has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.</p>

                    <p class="p-card">Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of
                        adventurers
                        working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s
                        chances
                        to
                        survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
                        Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how
                        they
                        met,
                        and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.</p>
